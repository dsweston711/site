            <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Few questions in the philosophy of religion have provoked as much
                enduring debate as the apparent conflict
                between divine omniscience and human free will. If God knows
                with absolute certainty that I will cry
                tomorrow, is it truly possible for me to do otherwise? This
                question is not merely theological; it strikes
                at the very heart of moral agency, responsibility, and what it
                means to act freely. For if the future is
                already known—fixed in the mind of an infallible being—then one
                is left to wonder whether freedom, in any
                robust sense, survives at all.</p>
            <p>The aim of this paper is to explore this problem with clarity and
                care. I begin with the thesis that divine
                omniscience, properly understood, entails the fixity of future
                truths. From this, I argue that such fixity
                is incompatible with libertarian free will—the notion that we
                possess genuine alternatives in our choices.
                Rather than attempting to offer a final resolution, I intend to
                examine each component of the problem in
                turn: the nature of omniscience, the structure of free will, and
                the logical implications of their
                coexistence. My hope is not to undermine faith, but to probe the
                philosophical coherence of beliefs often
                held in tandem. If nothing else, the inquiry may reveal whether
                we can sincerely affirm both divine
                omniscience and human freedom without contradiction—or whether
                one must, at some point, give way to the
                other.</p>

            <h2>II. The Dilemma Stated</h2>
            <p>At the heart of this inquiry lies a simple yet deeply unsettling
                proposition: if God knows with infallible
                certainty that a person will perform a specific action tomorrow,
                then it is not possible for that person to
                do otherwise. This claim, though intuitively forceful, requires
                careful articulation before its implications
                can be fully assessed. The conflict emerges from two seemingly
                incompatible commitments: (1) that God, being
                omniscient, knows all future events with certainty, and (2) that
                human beings possess libertarian free
                will—the capacity to choose between genuinely open
                alternatives.</p>
            <p>This tension may be framed as a logical dilemma:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>God is omniscient and therefore knows, from eternity, every
                    truth—including all future human actions.
                </li>
                <li>If God knows today that I will do X tomorrow, then it is
                    necessarily the case that I will do X.</li>
                <li>If it is necessarily the case that I will do X, then I lack
                    the ability to do otherwise.</li>
                <li>Libertarian free will requires the ability to do
                    otherwise.</li>
                <li>Therefore, if God is omniscient, libertarian free will is
                    not possible.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This structure forms the central problem around which the
                remainder of this paper will revolve. It is not
                enough to merely assert that God’s knowledge does not <em>cause</em> human actions; rather, one must ask whether such
                knowledge—fixed, unerring, and exhaustive—renders those actions
                metaphysically necessary. The remainder of
                this work will attempt to clarify what is meant by omniscience,
                what is required for freedom to be
                meaningful, and whether any reconciliation is logically
                tenable.</p>

            <h2>III. The Nature of Omniscience</h2>
            <p>To speak meaningfully about the relationship between omniscience
                and free will, one must first clarify what is meant by
                <em>omniscience</em>. In its classical formulation, omniscience refers to
                the possession of all knowledge: God knows all truths, about all things, at all times. This includes not only past and
                present facts, but also all future events—down to the most minute human decisions. Such knowledge is not probabilistic
                or predictive, but infallible and complete. If something is to occur, God knows it will occur; if it is not to occur,
                God knows it will not. But omniscience, thus conceived, entails more than mere scope—it entails fixity. For if God's
                knowledge is truly perfect, it cannot be subject to revision or error. To say that God once knew something false, or
                came to know something new, would be to deny His omniscience altogether. Therefore, God's knowledge must be unchanging.
                It does not shift with time, nor does it adapt in response to human actions. Rather, it is timelessly fixed: every truth
                God knows, He knows eternally and necessarily.</p>
                <p>This raises a crucial implication. If God knows today (or rather, outside of time) that I will perform action X
                tomorrow, then it is not merely true that I will perform X—it is already and eternally true, in the very content of
                God’s mind. It cannot fail to occur without rendering God mistaken, which is logically impossible under the concept of
                omniscience. Thus, the future, insofar as it is known by God, appears not open, but closed—its truths already settled.
                One might object that knowledge does not imply causation: that God’s knowing I will act in a certain way does not cause
                me to act so. This is granted. However, the objection misses the deeper point: it is not causality that is in question,
                but metaphysical necessity. If God knows I will do X, and God cannot be wrong, then my doing X is necessary in the
                strongest sense—it cannot be otherwise. And if it cannot be otherwise, then it is no longer clear in what sense I am
                free to do anything else.</p>

                <h2>Interlude: Does Knowledge Cause Action?</h2>
                <p>One common response to the foreknowledge dilemma is to assert that knowledge, even divine knowledge, is not <em>causal</em>. That
                is: just because God knows I will cry tomorrow does not mean He causes me to cry. Knowledge, the argument goes, is
                passive—it merely reflects reality, it does not shape it.</p>
                <p>At first glance, this seems plausible. But to evaluate the force of this objection, we must ask carefully: what is meant
                by “cause,” and what is meant by “knowledge”?</p>
                <p>In philosophical terms, a <em>cause</em> is typically that which brings about an effect. It can be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient (the hammer causes the nail to move),</li>
                    <li>Final (the end for which something is done),</li>
                    <li>Material (that out of which something is made), or</li>
                    <li>Formal (the structure or essence of the thing).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this context, “cause” is assumed to mean efficient cause—a prior agent or condition that brings about an effect in
                time. When one says <em>God's knowledge doesn’t cause your actions</em>, one is saying God’s act of knowing is not the mechanism
                that produces your behavior. This is true in a limited sense. God’s knowledge, classically understood, is not like a
                billiard ball striking another. He does not, by knowing, push the world forward in the way a physical cause does.
                However, this concedes too little. Because even if knowledge is not an efficient cause, it may still imply necessity—and
                necessity is exactly what free will cannot tolerate in its libertarian form.</p>
                <p>Knowledge, especially omniscient knowledge, is not mere belief. It is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>True</li>
                    <li>Justified (in a divine sense, perfectly grounded)</li>
                    <li>Certain (not contingent or subject to revision)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To <em>know</em> something is to affirm it as necessarily true, given the facts. When applied to God, this takes a stronger form: if God knows that
                I will do X tomorrow, then X must happen, or else God was in error—which is impossible. Therefore, while knowledge may
                not cause the action in the efficient sense, it entails the action’s necessity in the metaphysical sense.</p>
                <p>This is the heart of the confusion. Defenders of free will often distinguish:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Epistemic necessity: It is <em>known</em> that X will happen.</li>
                    <li>Metaphysical necessity: X <em>must</em> happen.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>They argue: <em>just because God knows what I’ll do, doesn’t mean I couldn’t have done otherwise—it only means that, in
                fact, I won’t</em>. But this collapses under scrutiny. For if it is <em>necessarily true</em> that God knows I will do X, and God
                cannot be mistaken, then the truth of X is locked in. There is no possible world in which God is omniscient and I do not
                do X. This is metaphysical necessity, even if it masquerades as epistemic certainty.</p>
                <p>The objection that “knowledge is not causation” is, in the end, a red herring. It is not God’s <em>causing</em> that undermines
                freedom—it is the certainty and fixity of divine knowledge that does. If God’s knowledge of future events is both exhaustive and unerring, then those events cannot occur otherwise. And if they cannot
                occur otherwise, then human beings are not free in the libertarian sense.</p>

                <h2>IV. The Nature of Free Will</h2>
                <p>To evaluate the tension between divine foreknowledge and human freedom, we must ask plainly: What does it mean to be
                free? In everyday speech, we speak of freedom in terms of acting voluntarily or without coercion. But in philosophical
                discourse—particularly within the framework of this debate—such a definition proves insufficient. The kind of freedom at
                stake here is not merely political, psychological, or experiential. It is metaphysical: the freedom to choose between
                genuinely possible alternatives. This stronger form of freedom is commonly referred to as libertarian free will. It
                holds that at any given moment, when a person makes a choice, they could have chosen otherwise. That is, given the exact
                same past and the exact same circumstances, it remained truly possible for the agent to select A or not-A. Without this
                possibility, moral responsibility becomes questionable. If I could not have refrained from lying, then in what sense can
                I be blamed for lying? If my choices are inevitable, am I still a moral agent, or merely a conscious instrument of
                inevitability?</p>
                <p>To affirm libertarian free will is to affirm that the future is, in some real sense, open. It is not merely unknown to
                us—it is <em>undetermined</em>. It is this openness that gives moral weight to our decisions, and meaning to our deliberations.
                If, by contrast, all future events are already settled—already known with absolute certainty by an infallible divine
                intellect—then it becomes difficult to explain how such openness could exist. Some have attempted to reconcile this
                tension by embracing compatibilism—the view that freedom and determinism can coexist. According to this position, a
                person is free so long as they act according to their own desires, even if those desires are themselves determined. But this redefinition, while
                resolving the problem linguistically, does so at the cost of philosophical depth. If my internal inclinations are
                themselves part of a fixed and necessary sequence, then the freedom I possess is freedom only in name, not in kind.</p>
                <p>In this paper, I proceed on the assumption that libertarian freedom—if it exists—is the only form worthy of the term
                “free will” in its full moral and existential sense. And it is this freedom that appears to stand in fundamental tension
                with a God who already knows, with infallible certainty, what I will do before I do it.</p>

                <h2>V. Revisiting the Tension</h2>
                <p>With the terms now made precise, the central dilemma may be restated more forcefully. If God is omniscient in the
                classical sense—knowing all truths, including all future events, with unerring certainty—then it necessarily follows
                that every human action is already known before it occurs. Not merely predicted, not merely likely, but known. The
                content of God’s knowledge cannot be otherwise. It cannot err, evolve, or adjust. Thus, if God knows that I will cry
                tomorrow, then it is necessarily the case that I will cry. The act is as fixed as any event in the past. But if the
                future is fixed in this way—if there exists no metaphysically possible world in which I do otherwise—then my capacity to
                choose between alternatives is illusory. This does not mean I act under duress, or against my will. Rather, it means
                that what I will choose is already true, already determined, already known. My actions become part of a settled
                ontology—a completed reality glimpsed from the divine vantage.</p>
                <p>This creates a sharp tension with libertarian free will, which demands that the future be open and undetermined until
                the moment of choice. The openness must be real, not just epistemic. But if God's knowledge is eternally fixed, then the
                future is not open. It is already written—indeed, already known in full. The moment I choose, I fulfill what was already
                infallibly foreknown. And if I could not have done otherwise without falsifying God’s knowledge, then I could not have
                done otherwise at all. Some have attempted to escape this dilemma through appeals to divine timelessness. God, it is
                said, does not “foresee” the future as we would, but rather knows all moments in an eternal present. Yet this
                formulation, while interesting, does not dissolve the problem. Whether God knows my action from eternity or from
                temporal vantage is immaterial—what matters is that the action is known infallibly, and thus it cannot be otherwise. The
                timelessness of God’s knowledge only deepens its necessity; it does not open space for freedom. Others invoke “middle
                knowledge,” the idea that God knows what I <em>would</em> freely choose in any possible circumstance. But this, too, collapses
                under scrutiny. For if what I would freely choose is known eternally, then I do not have the power to choose otherwise.
                The hypothetical becomes fixed, and with that fixity, freedom dissipates. In each case, the attempt to preserve
                libertarian freedom alongside divine omniscience fails to dispel the underlying necessity. The future, once known
                infallibly, becomes closed. And a closed future is incompatible with true metaphysical freedom.</p>
                
                <h2>VI. Attempted Reconciliations and Their Limits</h2>
                <p>The apparent conflict between divine omniscience and human freedom has not gone unnoticed by Christian philosophers.
                Indeed, many of the most esteemed figures in theological history have offered sophisticated models in an effort to reconcile the two. What follows is not a dismissal of these efforts,
                but a sober evaluation of whether they succeed in preserving libertarian freedom once omniscience is properly defined.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity/">Boethius</a>: God's Timelessness</h3>
                <p>Boethius famously argued that God does not exist in time and thus does not “foreknow” future events as we do. Instead,
                He experiences all time as a single, eternal present. From this vantage, God does not predict my action before I perform
                it—He simply sees it timelessly. This reframing dissolves the appearance of <em>fore</em>knowledge, but not the deeper problem.
                If God, from His eternal perspective, sees me perform action X, then I cannot fail to perform X. The fixity of His
                knowledge still entails that I cannot do otherwise. Thus, the necessity is not temporal but modal. God's timeless
                observation still leaves the future metaphysically closed.</p>
                <h3>Aquinas: Knowledge Through Divine Causality</h3>
                <p>Aquinas holds that God knows all things by knowing Himself as their cause. This knowledge is perfect and includes all
                contingent truths, but Aquinas argues that God's causality is compatible with human freedom, since He causes creatures
                to act in accordance with their own natures—including rational will. This model veers toward compatibilism by making
                divine causation and human volition coextensive. But again, if God’s knowledge is infallible, then regardless of whether
                the action is “freely” caused, it remains fixed. The issue is not whether we feel free or act voluntarily, but whether
                we <em>could have done otherwise</em>. If God’s knowledge includes my future actions necessarily, that possibility is foreclosed.</p>
                <h3>Molinism: Middle Knowledge</h3>
                <p>Luis de Molina proposes that God possesses <em>middle knowledge</em>—that is, knowledge of all counterfactuals of creaturely
                freedom. God knows what every free creature would do in every possible circumstance, and He uses this knowledge to
                actualize the world that aligns with His will. Middle knowledge preserves the appearance of freedom only by moving
                necessity one step back. If God infallibly knows what I <em>would</em> freely do in a given situation, and chooses to create that
                exact situation, then I cannot fail to do what He knows I would do. The freedom is effectively illusory. Moreover, the
                “grounding objection” remains: on what basis are such counterfactuals true before the creature chooses? If there is no
                fact grounding their truth, then God cannot know them infallibly.</p>
                <h3>Plantinga: Free Will Defense and Counterfactuals</h3>
                <p>Alvin Plantinga adopts Molinism to defend both human freedom and divine omniscience in the context of the problem of
                evil. He contends that free choices are logically prior to God’s creative decree: God knows what a creature would freely
                do, and creates accordingly. While Plantinga's formulation is analytically sharp, it shares Molina's underlying
                vulnerability. If God’s knowledge of future contingents is infallible and precedes creation, then those contingents are
                necessary in the actual world. The creature cannot choose otherwise without falsifying God’s knowledge, which would make
                God fallible—an impossibility under omniscience.</p>
                <h3>The Compatibilist Turn</h3>
                <p>Some theological traditions (especially within Reformed Protestantism) reject libertarian freedom altogether. They hold
                that humans are free in a compatibilist sense: so long as one acts according to their desires and without coercion, one
                is free—even if those desires are determined by God’s will. This avoids contradiction only by redefining freedom. But in
                doing so, it abandons what most people intuitively and morally understand by “free will.” If I act as I desire but
                cannot desire otherwise, the freedom is hollow. Compatibilism may preserve coherence, but it does so by conceding the
                loss of libertarian freedom—precisely the kind of freedom that moral responsibility presupposes.</p>
                <p>Each of these models seeks to preserve both divine foreknowledge and human freedom. Yet in every case, once divine
                omniscience is taken seriously as fixed, unerring, and exhaustive, the space for libertarian free will collapses.
                Whether by shifting the problem into eternity, dispersing it across possible worlds, or redefining freedom itself, the
                tension remains. The question is not whether God causes our actions, but whether we could have done otherwise. And if
                God’s knowledge is infallible, the answer must be no.</p>

                <h2>VII. Conclusion: On Freedom, Foreknowledge, and the Shape of Responsibility</h2>
                <p>This paper has argued that divine omniscience—understood as the fixed, infallible knowledge of all future truths—is
                incompatible with libertarian free will. Once God's knowledge of an event is granted as certain and unchangeable, the
                possibility of that event occurring otherwise is foreclosed. Freedom, in the robust sense, requires open possibilities;
                omniscience, as classically defined, eliminates them. Theologians and philosophers throughout history have recognized this tension, yet their attempts to reconcile the
                two often trade clarity for mystery or metaphysical necessity for rhetorical subtlety. Whether through appeals to divine
                timelessness, middle knowledge, or compatibilist reinterpretations of freedom, the fundamental problem remains: if God
                knows that I will do X, I cannot refrain from doing X without falsifying His knowledge. And God, by definition, cannot
                be wrong.</p>
                <p>But the implications of this dilemma extend beyond the abstract. If our choices are truly fixed in the divine intellect,
                then the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life must be reexamined. What becomes of repentance if God has always
                known we would repent? What becomes of forgiveness if God has always known we would sin? Are such acts meaningful, or
                merely the unfolding of an already-written script? Moreover, if God knows not only what I will do, but what I would do
                under every possible circumstance, then my moral character itself becomes predetermined—mapped in full from eternity.
                Can praise or blame survive in such a world? Is the sinner guilty of their act, or merely enacting what was always going
                to be? These questions do not admit of easy answers. Some may find comfort in the idea that God’s knowledge is simply
                beyond comprehension, and that freedom and foreknowledge coexist in a mystery transcending human logic. But for those
                who believe that truth matters—even in tension—this answer may not suffice. If we are to preserve both divine
                omniscience and meaningful moral agency, we must do more than rest in paradox. We must ask whether our concepts of God,
                time, and freedom are themselves in need of rethinking.</p>
                <p>This paper has not aimed to dismantle faith, but to subject one of its deepest claims to the scrutiny it deserves. If we
                are free, then perhaps God’s knowledge is not what we imagine. If God knows all, then perhaps our freedom is not what we
                claim. Either way, it is not enough to assert both without reckoning with what they entail.</p>
