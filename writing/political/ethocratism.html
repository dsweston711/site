        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
          A mode of governance, discourse, or moral reasoning wherein loyalty to
          a tribal identity—whether racial, ideological, cultural, sexual,
          &c.—supersedes universal principles, institutional neutrality, or
          individual merit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ethocratism prizes group allegiance above truth, and enforces its
          order through social coercion, moral absolutism, and the ritual
          purification of dissent.
        </p>

        <h2>Preface: On the Coinage of Ethocratism</h2>
        <p>
          This term is being developed by a student of Computer Science and
          Japanese, not as an academic authority, but as an observer of
          language, ideology, and the architecture of legitimacy in a world
          increasingly governed by identity over principle.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m using ChatGPT as a tool of refinement—not to produce ideas on my
          behalf, but to sharpen the ones I’ve already begun to form. Every
          phrase here is rooted in my own thought, clarified in dialogue, and
          offered in the spirit of intellectual transparency.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
          Over time, I’ve grown dissatisfied with the existing vocabulary
          available to describe the kinds of ideological behavior I see emerging
          across the cultural spectrum. Each term seems either too blunt, too
          historically misused, or too narrow in scope.
        </p>

        <h2>Terms I Reject</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fascism</strong> – too historically bound and rhetorically
            poisoned; now functions more as a slur than a diagnosis
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marxism</strong> – overused as a catch-all, often invoked
            without understanding dialectics or class theory
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wokeness</strong> – a floating signifier more useful for
            culture war ammunition than analytical precision
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tribalism</strong> – close in spirit, but too imprecise and
            primitive in connotation
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cult</strong> – too religious; suggests blind submission to
            a leader, not memetic decentralization
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Groupthink</strong> – overly Orwellian; implies incapacity
            rather than strategic identity enforcement
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Moralism / Moral Panic</strong> – accurate in tone, but
            insufficient for describing institutional power transfer
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identitarianism</strong> – tied too exclusively to far-right
            ideology, missing broader progressive forms
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why the Term Matters</h2>
        <p>
          “Ethocratism” names a system where group identity becomes the axis of
          moral and institutional legitimacy, and where power is asserted not
          through universal principle, but through identity enforcement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether in DEI bureaucracy, online tribunals, or nationalist revivals,
          this mode of governance demands a new conceptual tool. This is that
          attempt.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Derived from the Greek <em>ethnos</em> (tribe, people) and
          <em>kratos</em> (power, rule), ethocratism means, simply, rule by the
          tribe.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This term is still evolving. I offer it not as a final word, but a
          starting point. In naming it, we make it visible— and once visible, we
          can critique, resist, or refine it.
