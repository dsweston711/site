      <h2>I. Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Recent developments in American foreign policy—particularly the ongoing
        instability involving Iran and Israel—have served to underscore a
        broader political realignment underway in the United States. As the
        outlines of a post-2020s party system begin to emerge, it has become
        increasingly evident that both major political coalitions are entering a
        period of deep uncertainty. The Democratic Party, long characterized by
        internal ideological divisions, now finds itself in search of a viable
        contender to oppose the reemergence of a former president—an individual
        whose unique fusion of media spectacle, economic populism, and cultural
        grievance continues to command intense loyalty among a sizable portion
        of the electorate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within this environment, the boundaries of legitimate dissent have grown
        increasingly narrow. Criticism of the former president is frequently
        dismissed as obsession; skepticism of the opposition is met with
        accusations of betrayal. In such a climate, one might reasonably ask
        whether the underlying aims of our political struggle have been
        forgotten altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        Public discourse has, in many respects, drifted away from substantive
        engagement. It now resembles performance—less a contest between
        competing visions of the good, and more a symbolic clash of identities.
        And yet, beneath the noise, a quieter set of questions remains:
      </p>

      <p>What is the purpose of civil society?</p>

      <p>
        Who are its true constituents—not merely in name, but in shared
        responsibility?
      </p>

      <p>
        And what obligations do we bear toward one another in a pluralistic and
        democratic state?
      </p>

      <p>
        This paper does not seek to offer a partisan critique. Rather, it is a
        reflection on the structural and moral foundations of liberal society.
        In a time of deep division, it is worth reconsidering what it means to
        inhabit a shared space—one in which rights compete, obligations
        conflict, and the preservation of freedom requires not absolute
        autonomy, but a willingness to engage in trade-offs negotiated in good
        faith.
      </p>

      <p>
        If liberal democracy is to endure, it will not be on the basis of
        rhetorical appeals to freedom or justice, abstracted from lived
        experience. It will depend on our ability to understand the
        preconditions that make such ideals sustainable—and to accept the
        burdens they place upon us when we live among those who do not share our
        views.
      </p>

      <h2>II. The Death of Good Faith</h2>

      <p>
        Among the many assumptions that undergird liberal democracy, few are as
        vital—and as fragile—as the presumption of good faith. Though the
        Founding Fathers could not eliminate factionalism, they sought to temper
        its excesses by appealing to shared civic virtue. James Madison, for
        instance, warned of the dangers posed by majority passions and advocated
        institutional checks as a means of preserving republican order. Today,
        however, the political landscape increasingly reflects a breakdown of
        this foundational trust. Public discourse is no longer structured around
        disagreement between competing visions of the good, but around mutual
        suspicion, in which each side regards the other not as mistaken, but as
        fundamentally dangerous.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is tempting to believe that institutions alone are sufficient to
        safeguard liberty. Yet no legal system, no constitutional mechanism, can
        restrain a populace committed to acting in bad faith. Where trust
        dissolves, rules become performative; law is reduced to compliance under
        threat rather than legitimacy under consensus. In such a condition, the
        state is left with little more than the capacity to coerce. The
        question, then, is what remains as the motivating force of civic
        life—what serves as the “carrot” when shared belief has decayed? At
        present, it is not clear that one exists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Extremes on both ends of the political spectrum increasingly adopt
        similar modes of engagement. Among segments of the online left, even
        minor dissent may result in reputational censure; ideological purity
        becomes a prerequisite for inclusion. In parallel, the populist right,
        particularly in its more fervent manifestations, demands loyalty over
        principle, and regards deviation with hostility. These patterns do not
        represent a healthy pluralism; they signify a collapse of presumed
        decency—the civic courtesy of believing that others, even when mistaken,
        may still be acting in pursuit of the common good.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not to suggest that public frustration is without cause. The
        conditions that enabled the political rise of Donald Trump were not
        illusory; they emerged from authentic disaffection, cultural alienation,
        and a sense of systemic neglect. But there is a difference between
        acknowledging pain and weaponizing it. Collective grievance, however
        emotionally compelling, cannot substitute for civic repair. At some
        point, both citizens and institutions must reckon with a difficult
        question:
        <em>
          Are we operating in good faith—or are we driven primarily by
          resentment, fear, or antagonism toward those we do not fully
          understand?
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Though I do not profess Christian belief, I find certain scriptural
        insights philosophically instructive. “The wrath of man worketh not the
        righteousness of God” (James 1:20) speaks to the danger of moral
        certainty unaccompanied by humility. Outrage, however justified it may
        feel, has the power to obscure nuance and erode judgment. When we lose
        the ability to distinguish between disagreement and malice, we forfeit
        the possibility of deliberation and revert to tribalism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most individuals, I believe, act from a sincere conviction that their
        actions serve the public good. The failure lies not in motive, but in
        perception: few are willing to extend the same sincerity to those who
        oppose them. This, more than ideological division itself, marks the true
        death of good faith.
      </p>

      <h2>III. Freedom as a Trade-Off</h2>

      <p>
        Thomas Sowell is often quoted as saying,
        <em>“There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.”</em> While this
        observation is frequently cited in political discourse, it is rarely
        treated with the seriousness it warrants. Too often, the phrase is
        invoked to deflect criticism or terminate discussion, rather than to
        invite a deeper examination of what liberty requires in practice. Yet if
        taken seriously, it exposes a central tension in modern governance: that
        every freedom we enjoy is conditioned by structures that also constrain
        us.
      </p>

      <p>
        To illustrate this point, imagine an individual living alone on a remote
        island. There is no state, no legal apparatus, no neighbors, no taxes—no
        external authority of any kind. One is, in this hypothetical scenario,
        utterly and indisputably free. But what does that freedom entail?
      </p>

      <p>
        In such conditions, one may act without interference. One may attempt to
        build a raft, gather food, create shelter, or cry out into the
        wilderness. One is free to try—and free to fail. What one lacks,
        however, is any form of protection or support. There is no freedom from
        illness, from injury, from exposure, from isolation, or from despair.
        What exists is negative liberty—the absence of coercion—but not positive
        liberty, which entails the presence of capacity, opportunity, and
        security.
      </p>

      <p>This distinction is essential:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Freedom to</em> refers to the absence of external constraint.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Freedom from</em> refers to the presence of enabling
          conditions—social, material, and institutional—that make meaningful
          choice possible.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Modern political life depends upon both.</p>

      <p>
        Consider some common examples of “freedom from” in contemporary society:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Freedom from infectious disease.</li>
        <li>Freedom from arbitrary violence.</li>
        <li>Freedom from autocratic rule.</li>
        <li>
          Freedom from unsafe infrastructure or unregulated food and medicine.
        </li>
        <li>Freedom from systemic illiteracy or lack of educational access.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These freedoms are not the products of spontaneous order. They are the
        results of deliberate social investment—secured by law, maintained by
        institutions, and funded through collective sacrifice. They require
        coordination, oversight, and, inevitably, regulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each of these protections is also generative. For every “freedom from,”
        there is a corresponding “freedom to”:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Freedom from illiteracy enables the freedom to read, to express, and
          to participate in public life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Freedom from foodborne illness enables the freedom to consume safely
          and with confidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Freedom from lawlessness enables the freedom to speak, worship, and
          assemble.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Such benefits are not without cost. But the notion of a purely
        minimalist state—one in which government involvement is reduced to the
        vanishing point—fails to account for the interdependence required to
        sustain even basic freedoms. The conditions of modern life, from the
        buildings we inhabit to the roads we travel and the technologies we rely
        upon, are all subject to regulatory frameworks. These frameworks, though
        imperfect, are not imposed arbitrarily. They exist because risk is real,
        and because the consequences of neglect can be profound.
      </p>

      <p>
        To view regulation merely as restriction is to misunderstand its
        purpose. At its best, regulation is a form of risk management—a
        mechanism through which society curbs reckless behavior, prevents
        foreseeable harm, and fosters trust in public systems. This is not to
        deny that regulation can overreach. Bureaucracy can become inefficient,
        policies can be poorly designed, and oversight can be captured by
        special interests. These concerns merit serious scrutiny. But to reject
        regulation categorically is not an argument grounded in principle; it is
        an abdication of realism.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pursuit of liberty, therefore, must not be imagined as escape from
        society, but as a form of life enabled by it. The ideal is not the
        isolated autonomy of the castaway, but the shared capacity to act
        meaningfully within a stable and cooperative order.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put simply, liberty is not diminished by structure. It is made possible
        by it.
      </p>

      <h2>IV. Freedom and Religion</h2>

      <p>
        The relationship between freedom and religion has long been marked by
        complexity. While both claim to provide guiding frameworks for human
        conduct, they frequently approach the question of moral authority from
        fundamentally different perspectives. Religion, particularly in its
        revealed forms, often grounds moral obligation in divine command.
        Liberal societies, by contrast, tend to frame moral responsibility in
        terms of personal autonomy and mutual respect within pluralistic
        communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        My own position on this matter is shaped by a moral philosophy known as
        <em>emotivism</em>. According to this view, when individuals make moral
        claims—such as, for instance, <em>“homosexuality is a sin”</em>—they are
        not stating objective truths, but rather expressing evaluative
        attitudes. In its most distilled form, such a statement becomes:
        <em>“homosexuality—nay.”</em> Moral discourse, on this account, is not
        akin to mathematics or empirical science. It is a reflection of deeply
        embedded intuitions and social norms—felt, learned, and historically
        contingent.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this standpoint, I find the claim that Christian moral frameworks
        are objectively grounded to be philosophically unpersuasive. If the God
        of Christian theism exists and is capable of inscribing moral law onto
        the human heart—as passages such as Romans 2:15 suggest—then one is left
        to wonder why divine will remains so persistently subject to
        interpretive conflict. If God intends for moral truth to be known and
        followed, why is that truth not made unmistakably clear? Why, instead,
        has so much of human history been marked by theological division and
        moral uncertainty?
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, when believers claim they are “following Jesus’ teachings” or
        “doing what God wants,” I do not interpret such assertions as statements
        of certainty, but as confessions of faith—necessarily filtered through
        human limitations, cultural assumptions, and fallible reasoning. My only
        request, as a fellow participant in moral inquiry, is for clarity and
        candor.
      </p>

      <p>I will offer the same in return.</p>

      <p>
        My own moral framework is not grounded in revelation. It emerges from
        personal experience, sustained reflection, and intuitive response. I do
        not claim to possess ultimate knowledge of what is right. I only know
        what feels coherent and just, given the circumstances I have lived. I do
        not claim moral authority—only sincerity.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is important to note that my critique of certain forms of Christian
        moral reasoning is not intended to disparage the individuals who hold
        such views. In fact, I believe many Christians—especially those
        committed to fundamentalist interpretations—are motivated by a sincere
        desire to reduce harm, preserve order, and remain faithful to what they
        perceive as divine instruction. They are, in their own way, striving for
        the good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nor is such striving exclusive to the religious. The progressive
        activist, the secular philosopher, the libertarian dissenter—all are, in
        different ways, pursuing a vision of justice. What is striking—and
        concerning—is how rarely we extend to one another the presumption of
        moral earnestness. Increasingly, we view those who disagree with us not
        as principled individuals arriving at different conclusions, but as
        enemies, obstructing a path we believe is obvious.
      </p>

      <p>
        This loss of trust is not merely a cultural tragedy; it is a threat to
        civic stability. The task before us is not to agree on moral
        conclusions, but to recover the possibility of mutual understanding. As
        an example: I would ask the Christian reader to consider whether the
        transgender individual might also be seeking a better world—one rooted
        in dignity, peace, and acceptance. And I would ask the secular
        progressive to consider whether the devout Christian might not be
        clinging blindly to tradition, but rather attempting, with humility, to
        live in accordance with what they believe to be a higher order. In both
        cases, the goal is not agreement, but recognition of the other as a
        fellow moral agent.
      </p>

      <p>
        This, I would argue, is where civil society must begin again: not in
        consensus, but in the renewal of imaginative empathy—the capacity to
        enter, however briefly, into the worldview of another.
      </p>

      <p>What does this have to do with freedom?</p>

      <p>
        Interestingly, religion—particularly in its legalistic or covenantal
        forms—offers a conception of liberty that may still hold value. In many
        traditions, the principle is clear: individuals are free to act unless a
        specific action is expressly forbidden. This mirrors the
        negative-liberty tradition found in constitutional law, in which freedom
        is not defined exhaustively, but rather structured by exceptions. The
        American legal system, since <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>, has largely
        operated according to this logic—reacting to specific challenges, rather
        than issuing comprehensive ethical directives in advance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this sense, religious and constitutional traditions converge: both
        acknowledge that liberty requires boundaries. Moral law, like legal
        precedent, is not a map so much as a process—reactive, interpretive, and
        always subject to revision in light of new understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I do not personally affirm divine law, I can appreciate the
        structure it provides. Freedom without form becomes chaos. Liberty
        without mutual obligation becomes license. The moral contours of
        religious life may, at their best, remind us that the right to act must
        be tempered by a responsibility to others.
      </p>

      <h2>V. The Paradox of Social Benefit</h2>

      <p>
        One of the most underappreciated truths of civic life is that, in many
        cases, by helping others, we help ourselves. This is not merely a moral
        aspiration, nor a vague appeal to karmic balance. It is a material,
        structural fact. When public infrastructure is funded, when educational
        institutions are strengthened, when others are housed, vaccinated, or
        nourished, the society we all inhabit becomes more stable, more
        prosperous, and more livable.
      </p>

      <p>
        This presents a paradox for the individualist framework: that in ceding
        a measure of autonomy, we often acquire greater freedom in
        return—freedom from uncertainty, from danger, from disrepair. Our
        limitations, in a well-functioning civil society, are not solely defined
        by individual ability. They are bounded—or expanded—by the collective
        capacities of the institutions and relationships to which we belong.
      </p>

      <p>
        I do not write this as a Marxist, nor as a socialist. I do not believe
        in the inevitable collapse of capitalism, nor do I accept the premises
        of dialectical materialism. These labels, when applied casually, often
        reflect more suspicion than understanding. My view is simpler, and
        perhaps more enduring: that the strength of a free society lies in the
        mutual uplift of its members; that the well-being of the individual is
        often inseparable from the well-being of the group; and that we are able
        to build far more together than we ever could alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider a road. Its existence benefits the business owner, the
        commuter, the teacher, the emergency responder, the parent, and the
        student. Consider public health: when others are treated, our collective
        risk is reduced. Consider education: when literacy and skill are
        widespread, economies flourish. Even those who advocate most strongly
        for independence and self-reliance rely upon publicly maintained
        systems—law enforcement, intellectual property protections, regulated
        transportation, and digital infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        These systems are not luxuries. They are not handouts. They are
        investments—investments in the civic fabric that sustains modern life.
        And like any sound investment, they yield returns. They benefit not only
        the vulnerable, but also the secure, not only the dependent, but also
        those who imagine themselves self-sufficient.
      </p>

      <p>
        One does not need to be a collectivist to recognize this. One only needs
        to be honest.
      </p>

      <p>
        The paradox of social benefit is this: that our highest autonomy is made
        possible through our interdependence. The more we ensure that others are
        protected, educated, and supported, the more we expand the conditions
        under which liberty can be meaningfully exercised. This is not idealism.
        It is realism.
      </p>

      <p>
        A society in which only the strong flourish is not truly free. It is
        simply a jungle dressed in constitutional language.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make this point more concrete, consider the military. It is often
        held up as the embodiment of discipline, sacrifice, and national
        service. Yet the military is perhaps the clearest institutional example
        of collective benefit. No soldier thrives in isolation. Each depends
        upon coordination, logistics, and mutual trust. The unit matters more
        than the individual. The success of one depends on the strength of all.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have spoken to veterans who understand this paradox intuitively. They
        have lived it. They know that their safety in combat often depended on
        the competence and care of others, just as the lives of others depended
        on them. In the field, individualism is not a virtue. It is a liability.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yet, when these same veterans return home, they often find that the
        society they defended is unwilling to provide the same degree of care
        and coordination. Basic access to healthcare, housing, and reintegration
        support is frequently limited. We honor the idea of sacrifice in
        rhetoric while denying the structures that make such sacrifice
        sustainable in practice. This is not a failure of means. It is a failure
        of civic imagination.
      </p>

      <p>
        The military reminds us that we do not survive alone. Civil society—at
        its best—is how we carry that insight forward into peacetime.
      </p>

      <h2>VI. Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>

      <p>We cannot act as if the other is evil.</p>
      <p>We cannot act as if our individual vote does not matter.</p>
      <p>
        We cannot act as if we are not a meaningful splash in the puddle of the
        population.
      </p>
      <p>Because the moment we do, we lose the plot.</p>

      <p>
        We lose the shared trust that makes disagreement tolerable. We lose the
        sense of agency that makes civic participation meaningful. And we lose
        the quiet dignity that comes from knowing that, however small our
        influence may seem, it does ripple outward.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is what makes democracy—not perfect, but better. Better than all
        the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not because it guarantees virtue, but because it permits correction.
        Because it allows for messiness without collapsing into violence.
        Because it lets us fight with words instead of blood. Because it assumes
        that power must be distributed, not hoarded.
      </p>

      <p>So—where do we go from here?</p>

      <p>
        We begin with good faith—not blind trust, but the willingness to assume
        that others, even our opponents, might be acting on principle rather
        than malice.
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin with trade-offs—recognizing that freedom is not absolute, and
        that in giving up a little, we often gain much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin with humility—acknowledging that none of us hold the full
        truth, and that every worldview is shaped by interpretation, history,
        and instinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin with honesty—about our motivations, our biases, our fears, and
        our hopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        And we begin with the recognition that we are not alone. That we belong
        to a shared project—one that is old, fragile, and worth saving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Civil society is not a slogan. It is a daily choice. It is built in
        trust, guarded by discourse, and made real through the quiet, deliberate
        act of assuming we are still in this together.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we want to preserve freedom, then let us start acting like we deserve
        it.
