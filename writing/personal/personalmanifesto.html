        <h1>I. ON PRINCIPLES AND APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>
          I do not speak to curry favour, nor to delight the multitude. I speak
          to illuminate. Should the truth estrange me from popularity or
          station, let the rift remain. I shall not delegate my conscience to
          the safety of consensus, nor drape myself in the garb of neutrality
          when judgement is due. That coward's refrain—"I know not"—shall not
          find comfort in my mouth when knowledge abides in my heart.
        </p>

        <h1>II. ON EXPOSURE AND CHARACTER</h1>
        <p>
          I shall conduct myself in private as though the world’s eye were upon
          me. Not from vanity, but from resolve. Let it never be said that I
          fear the revelation of my own life. That which is hidden shall one day
          be known, and so I prepare not by concealment, but by constancy. If
          dread of exposure stirs within me, it is a summons to refinement, not
          retreat.
        </p>

        <h1>III. ON JUDGEMENT AND ITS NECESSITY</h1>
        <p>
          To judge is not to revile, but to discern—and to act when action
          becomes obligation. I shall not confuse silence with virtue, nor
          indulgence with grace. Yet I know that not all matters demand my
          verdict. Let me withhold judgment where wisdom permits—but not where
          inaction becomes consent. Where betrayal compels a stance, I shall not
          flinch. Where hypocrisy festers, I shall not feign blindness. Let my
          judgment, when summoned, be neither rash nor delayed, but precise,
          restrained, and unyielding in its justice.
        </p>

        <h1>IV. ON FRIENDSHIP AND FIDELITY</h1>
        <p>
          A friend absent in the hour of one’s trial is no friend but a
          spectator cloaked in familiarity. I shall not profess loyalty yet
          vanish when courage is called. If I would wish defence when wronged, I
          must offer it in turn. Agreement is not the test of affection—but
          presence, steadfast and seen, is.
        </p>

        <h1>V. ON THE PRACTICE OF CLARITY</h1>
        <p>
          Each day I shall interrogate my own integrity before daring to measure
          another’s. Moral clarity is not a posture to be struck, but a labour
          to be undertaken. When I falter, I will confess it. When I stray, I
          will amend. Let my words and deeds be of the same substance, unmixed
          with performance.
        </p>

        <h1>VI. ON THE SELF I SHALL BECOME</h1>
        <p>
          What I build is not renown, nor admiration, nor following—but a self
          that may endure all weathers. Let my manner, my judgements, my habits,
          and my countenance form a single line, unmarred by contradiction. Let
          those who scrutinise my life find nothing cunning, nothing
          counterfeit, nothing hollow.
        </p>

        <h1>VII. ON THE GOLDEN RULE AND DEFEAT WITH DIGNITY</h1>
        <p>
          I shall treat others as I myself would wish to be treated, not only in
          triumph, but in their hour of loss. The golden rule is not a
          convenience, but a commandment; it binds most tightly when pride would
          see it cast aside. When I am bested—by debate, by contest, by life—I
          shall yield with grace, not bitterness. Let me not conflate defeat
          with dishonour. For to lose well is a virtue rarer than victory.
        </p>

        <h1>VIII. ON CHANGE AND THE PRESENT HOUR</h1>
        <p>
          Change is not the enemy—it is the tutor of the resolute. I shall not
          fear its coming, nor curse its passage. Whether it elevates or
          humbles, I shall meet it with discernment and open eyes. Let me not
          defer my transformation to some distant hour. The past is ash; the
          future, mist. Only the present is real, and it demands my full
          attention. If I am to become more than I am, I must act with clarity
          <em>now</em>. Not tomorrow, not when the mood is right, but now. My
          better self does not lie ahead—it lies in the choice I make in this
          moment.
        </p>

        <h1>IX. ON THE VANITY OF UNLIVED VIRTUE</h1>
        <p>
          Let me not be one who speaks of virtue yet shirks its burden. To know
          what is good and fail to pursue it is no less damning than ignorance
          itself. If I find in my own counsel the superior path, let me take it.
          If my words offer wisdom, let them guide my conduct. To write a
          manifesto and live contrary to its charge is not merely hypocrisy—it
          is waste. These are not idle musings, but directives. They must be
          etched upon the heart, not left to fade upon the page. Better to live
          quietly with honour than to preach loudly and lie in deed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not theatre. This is not apology. This is no costume donned
          for men’s applause.
        </p>

        <p>This is the making of a man who is whole.</p>
